# Mechanisms of Shock Dissipation in Semicrystalline Polyethylene

Included are LAMMPS data files for semicrystalline polyethylene (SCPE) and crystalline polyethylene (CPE) systems. Directories are organized by united atom or all atom representation, then system type, then pressure.

0e0_atm data files are post-equilibration using NVT (for SCPE) or NPT (for CPE). All other data files are post-equilibration using NPHug.
